This repository is a challenge proposed by [DIO](https://www.dio.me/en) (Digital Innovation One) - **"Forma√ß√£o Claro - Java com Spring Boot"**.

### Challenge proposal üìù
In this challenge the proposal was to apply business analysis concepts and object-oriented programming requirements and UML modeling to build the model of classes and interfaces in order to simulate the features of the first iPhone: Music Player, Telephone Calls and Internet Browser.

### My UML diagram representation üìà
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Spotify {
        +play()
        +pause()
        +selectSong(String music)
    }

    class Phone {
        +call(String number)
        +answerThePhone()
        +voiceMail()
    }

    class Browser {
        +displayPage(String url)
        +newTab()
        +reloadPage()
    }

    class iPhone {
    }

    iPhone --> Spotify
    iPhone --> Phone
    iPhone --> Browser
```
> [!NOTE]
> The diagram model above was built with the tools available on the [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) website.
